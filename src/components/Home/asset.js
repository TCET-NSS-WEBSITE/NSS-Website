      "JAI HIND ! I tended to gravitate towards solitary activities, preferring to spend my time alone watching movies, learning something new, or simply sitting quietly with my thoughts. Social situations made me uncomfortable, and I often felt like I didn't belong. That's when I decided to step out of my comfort zone and join NSS.Without a question, the best aspect of my experience was the recruitment procedure. I was able get exposure while engaging in a variety of activities by joining NSS, in addition to giving me a chance to give back to society. During the projects, I found myself engaging in teamwork and collaboration, something I had always shied away from. Working with fellow volunteers on community projects became a catalyst for personal growth. I discovered the joy of contributing to something larger than myself. The experience of organizing and Participating in a range of activities, including cleanliness drives, visits to old age homes, blood donations, and The Sojourn Dance, within the NSS has afforded me diverse settings and opportunities. These experiences have contributed to the development of my ability to effectively balance my commitment to serving others with the pursuit of personal fulfillment and enjoyment. One of the most surprising aspects was the support and camaraderie I found among my fellow volunteers. The shared goal of making a positive impact brought us together, and I realized that I wasn't alone in my journey.Being part of NSS has been one of the most significant experiences in my life. I believe everyone should consider dedicating a small portion of their lives to helping others. In doing so, you lose nothing but gain a unique and fulfilling kind of happiness. JAI HIND ! ",

    testament: `One joins NSS in order to be altruistic and assist those around them, but I can guarantee with certainty that volunteering with this amazing FAMILY will help you become the best version of yourself. NSS is without a doubt our college's most formidable body, as evidenced by our effort and zeal, but don't mistake this strength for a lack of enjoyment. My time as a volunteer has been the most fun I've had in years. From debate competitions to Old age home visits, from blood donations to The ELECTRIC Sojourn Dance, NSS has given me a variety of settings and opportunities to strengthen my ability to balance my need to serve others with my need to have a good time. It is here that I have witnessed my efforts make a significant difference in the lives of the needy, as well as where I have witnessed perfect strangers become best friends. Aise hi nahi hum khudko family ka title dete hai, when I needed it, I had a stronghold of 200 volunteers on my side, which is what every college student hopes for. Even if my official volunteer status has ended (once a volunteer, always a volunteer), my connection to NSS simply grows deeper with time. I will be grateful to my dependable councils and my fellow volunteers forever and always.`,
